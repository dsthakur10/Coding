// Fix children-sum property

/*

Convert any binary tree to one that follows the children-sum property.

The children sum property is defined as:
    "For every node of the tree, the value of a node is equal to the sum of values of its children
    (left child and right child)"

NOTE:
    - The node values can be increased by 1 any number of times but decrement of any node value is not allowed.
    - A value for a NULL node can be assumed as 0.
    - You are not allowed to change the structure of the given binary tree.

// ONLY Top-Down or ONLY Bottom-Up ain't enough here.
